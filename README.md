# UCB-Project-1-ELK-Stack
This project is the first of 3 projects I created during my time in the UCB course. In this project I created a cloud based server using Azure Labs. The server has a virtual network that is running a website open to the internet and a second virtual network that is monitering the web traffic with the use of an ELK stack.
